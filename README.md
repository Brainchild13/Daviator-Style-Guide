# Daviator-Style-Guide

> This style guide was built to enable developers to shorten their development time. As a full-stack developer, I find myself repeating the same styles and designs, and so I thought why not make a template with the basic styles that I use most often, and then create a templating-type system to start all of my projects, based on my experience in the industry.
